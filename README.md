##### 1. Change permalinks
Go to `Settings -> Permalinks` in the admin panel and pick the desired option.

##### 2. Don't crop on thumbnails
Go to `Settings -> Media` in the admin panel and uncheck `crop on thumbnails`.

##### 3. Disable comments
Go to `Settings -> Discussion` in the admin panel and uncheck `leave comments on new posts`.

##### 4. Hide notifications
To hide update notifications for all users but the admin user, copy the code below to your functions.php file
```
function hide_update_notice_to_all_but_admin_users()
{
    if (!current_user_can('update_core')) {
        remove_action( 'admin_notices', 'update_nag', 3 );
    }
}
add_action( 'admin_head', 'hide_update_notice_to_all_but_admin_users', 1 );
```

##### 5. Hide version
To hide the WordPress version, add rhe following to your functions.php file
```
<?php remove_action('wp_head', 'wp_generator'); ?>
```

If you have a static IP and you know all the IP's from where people will access the admin part of the site, you can copy the  .htaccess file from `assets/wp-admin/.htaccess` in this repo inside your wp-admin folder (NOT root directory). Don't forgot to input your IP to be able to access the admin area yourself.

define( 'WP_POST_REVISIONS', 3 );
```

```
function custom_login_logo() { echo '<style type="text/css"> h1 a { background-image: url('.get_bloginfo('template_directory').'/images/custom-login-logo.png) !important; } </style>'; } 
add_action('login_head', 'custom_login_logo');
```
